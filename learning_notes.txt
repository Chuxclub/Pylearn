Switch cases in python:

def hangman_states(case):
    switcher = {
        1: hangman_state1,
        2: hangman_state2,
        3: hangman_state3,
        4: hangman_state4,
        5: hangman_state5,
        6: hangman_state6,
        7: hangman_state7,
        8: hangman_state8
    }

    return switcher.get(case, "State doesn't exist")()

Switch cases in Python don't exist. But we can use dictionaries to replace them
