# What: Prints the title of the program on launch with a small animation
#
# How : Animation is made thanks to calls of the sleep function in time library
#
# Why: As the program sleeps regularly the title is slowly revealed giving the "animated"
#      effect. Title is centered thanks to the .center() string method and terminal width
#      variable collected throught get_terminal_size() function in the os library.
#
# Complexity (time): O(1)

# Author: Florian Legendre
#
# What: Brings up a menu when the game is over with the possibility
#       to choose between watching the solution to do better next time
#       or going back to the main menu
#
# How : Exceptions allows controlling the undesired inputs, those which
#       don't match the inputs indicated in the previous 'if' conditions
#       statements. Going back to the main menu is made thanks to a 0 returned
#       as this 0 is caught by another return in hanoi_game() hence bringing back
#       the main_menu() where hanoi_game() was initially launched
#
# Why: \
#
# Complexity (time): If the animation is played -> O(nÂ²) as the hanoi_solver has
#                    quadratic complexity
#
# Self-Criticism: The code looks a bit messy. I'm not sure what I could do to improve
#                 readibility

# Author: Florian Legendre
#
# What: Brings up the hanoi game loop which is => input > parse input
#       > system applies input > etc. It's basically the core game function
#
# How : Here I say "parse input" because the user can enter any string
#       and the game will analyze this string and make the appropriate
#       operations. Parsing is made in <input_parsers> thanks to
#       input_parse() function.
#
#       Before the input parsing a simple loop
#       checks if an authorized command has been entered which allows
#       leaving the game, playing the solution animation  and such.
#       As moving a ring requires at least two information (ring_id and
#       targeted_tower_id), a first check of an impossible input is done
#       through len(user_input) < 2 condition.
#
#       input_parse() returns a list consisting of a ring_id and a
#       targeted_tower_id which is a string. This last string is converted into
#       an int for the simplicity of the code. If the parser finds an error
#       it returns impossible ids in this game such as -1, -1. 
#
#       Finally, after the input is parsed I check whether or not it corresponds
#       to an existing tower or ring. There are always three towers named 1, 2, 3
#       as ints. An empty tower (no ring) is a tower. So if it catches -1, -1 it
#       immediately acknowledges the error and sends an exception invalidating the movement.
#
#       End of the game is detected thanks to tower2 comparison with initial state of tower1
#       saved in the win_condition variable. Moves_counter simply allows to let the player
#       know in the game menu whether or not they found the optimal solution.
#       Difficulty_level affects the heights of the towers.
#
# Why: \
#
# Complexity (time): Depends on many factors...
#
# Self-Criticism: This way of parsing input is messy or at least could be divided in many
#                 functions
