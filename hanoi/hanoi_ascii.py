# What: Returns a list containing the characters corresponding to a ring.
#       This list will be concatenated with the other rings of the same line
#       in print_towers() below and print as such.
#
# How : In order to always have then same length, whitespaces fill the list
#       corresponding on the size of the ring.
#
#       For example: if ring_size is 0 (size parameter here), then the list only has
#       whitespaces in it. If the ring_size is above 0 then if fills the list with the
#       appropriate characters.
#
#       All the lists (e.g rings) have the same size based on the maximum ring size which
#       also happens to 2 times the size of the towers + 1... For example: my towers have height
#       of 3 lines, then my maximum ring has a size of 7 characters <----->
#
# Why: \
#
# Complexity (time): O(2*tower_size)
#
# Self-Criticism: \

# Author: Florian Legendre
#
# What: Concatenates all the lists produced byt the functions above
#       and print the result on the screen line by line thanks to a
#       for loop from top to bottom.
#
# How : The floor is printed out and after the loop as its size is constant and
#       thus being more simple to produce. + It's on the bottom.
#
# Why: \
#
# Complexity (time): O(towers_sizeÂ²)
